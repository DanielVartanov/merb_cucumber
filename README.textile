h1. merb_cucumber

Merb + Cucumber integration with Webrat support.

h2. Requirements

* merb-core >  0.9.10
* cucumber  >= 0.1.8
* webrat    >= 0.2.2 (Optional)

h2. First Time

Inside your merb project root, run
  
  $ merb-gen cucumber
  
For Webrat support, run 

  $ merb-gen cucumber --session-type webrat

This will also install a sample login feature that should pass if you're using merb-auth.

h2. Usage

To execute all the features run

  $ rake features

h2. Notes

* When you are implementing the steps of an scenario, please use the new request test helper, if you try to use the
  dispatch_to method, it won't work as expected.
* Webrat considers all status codes above 299 to be errors. We are trying to change that upstream, but if you're reading this notice the situation hasn't changed yet. While this is case, the sample feature won't pass unless you have patched your version of webrat.
